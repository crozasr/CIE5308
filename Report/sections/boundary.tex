The design storm with less than 20\% probability of failure of the breakwater within a lifetime of 100 years returns every 500 years.
The available 22 years of (modelled) wave data\footnote{ARGOSS XX} close to the site is analysed in a Peak over Threshold analysis using a threshold of $H_s=1.5m$, a storm duration of nine hours and a Weibull distribution to extrapolate the data.
This yields a significant wave height of $H_{ss}=7.91m$ for a 500 year storm, which is chosen to be the deep water design wave height: $H_{ss,d}=7.91m$.
