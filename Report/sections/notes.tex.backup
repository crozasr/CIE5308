\section{18.03.16 - lecture introducing exercise}

\textbf{Main aim}: design breakwater
\begin{enumerate}
 \item new breakwater
 \item adjust existing one
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Location}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item ..
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Present situation}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item cross-section, what they were supposed to build
 \item slide 9: measured cross-section
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assignment}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item three locations
 \item three design lifes: after so many years needs to be maintained/rebuild, not for design cinditions!
 \item something with the existing (Bas)...?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item assume: subsoil no problem
 \item Any idea where the rock comes from? Quarries in ALbania? Albania exports a lot of Marble to Italy. How about the stones sorted out?
 \item Infra structure in Albania not as good.
 \item Google Earth because you can check time. Check -design period and +design period from present.
 \item Play with colors in picture editor. Image processing for bathymetry stuff.
 \item Map Room: Libarary of faculty of architecture, first floor within library. And webpage of this library? And webapp.navionics.com (not working for 4G.
 \item Check wave data from design wind speed $\rightarrow$ should be in same magnitude as from Argoss (verify data)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Argoss}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item sells  wave data
 \item www.waveclimate.com
 \item TuDelft DuT4321 valid until 31.3.
 \item Size of piece: find balance (density of data is the same, too big, not appropriate anymore, too small, not enough data any more)
 \item 1D, 2D, 3D
 \item don't use their model for nearshore
\end{itemize}

\textbf{B.C.}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item B.C. damage vs. B.C. operation of port
 \item 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Presentation}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Why did you make this choices you made?
 \item Presentation and questions of group will be graded.
 \item
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Report}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Indicate 2.1 to 2.6 clearly in report
 \item Make it possible to enable contractor for a pricing
 \item Drawing on A3
 \item only cross-section, only one
 \item head needs not to be designed?
 \item only 10 pages text
 \item report should be understandable without annex
 \item 
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Check}:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item google earth
 \item make pdfs from ppt's
 \item Argoss book online or from library
 \item check demands on slides, slide 21  e.g.
 \item 
\end{enumerate}
