***********************************
* This is Make Bibliography Style *
***********************************
It makes up a docstrip batch job to produce
a customized .bst file for running with BibTeX
Do you want a description of the usage? (NO)

\yn=y
In the interactive dialogue that follows,
you will be presented with a series of menus.
In each case, one answer is the default, marked as (*),
and a mere carriage-return is sufficient to select it.
(If there is no * choice, then the default is the last choice.)
For the other choices, a letter is indicated
in brackets for selecting that option. If you select
a letter not in the list, default is taken.

The final output is a file containing a batch job
which may be (La)TeXed to produce the desired BibTeX
bibliography style file. The batch job may be edited
to make minor changes, rather than running this program
once again.

Enter the name of the MASTER file (default=merlin.mbs)

\mfile=

Name of the final OUTPUT .bst file? (default extension=bst)
